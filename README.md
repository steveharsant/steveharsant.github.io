# steveharsant.github.io

This repository aims to operate as a central place to serve javascript files, as rawgit.com CDN is shutting down soon (at the time of writing this).

## Note

The javascript files here are for a specific site, simply copy/pasting into your site will not work, but rather send them to the site they are intended for.

## Usage

## newsletter_subscribe.js

Place this in a `code` block and ensure the script is called in the `head` inject section.

```html
<div id="newsletter_subscribe_form"></div>
```
